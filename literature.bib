	abstract = {Classical and Quantum Parametric Phenomena provides an overview of the phenomena arising when parametric pumping is applied to oscillators. These phenomena include parametric amplification, noise squeezing, spontaneous symmetry breaking, activated switching, cat states, and synthetic Ising spin lattices. To understand these effects, topics such as nonlinear and stochastic dynamics, coupled systems, and quantum mechanics are introduced. Throughout the book, introductions are kept as succinct as possible and attention is focused on understanding parametric oscillators. As a result, the text helps readers to familiarize themselves with many aspects of parametric systems and understand the common theoretical origin of nanomechanical sensors, optical amplifiers, and superconducting qubits. Parametric phenomena have enabled important scientific breakthroughs over the last decades and are still at the focus of intense research efforts. This book provides a resource for experimental and theoretical physicists entering the field or wishing to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying connections. This includes combining formal and intuitive explanations, accompanied by exercises based on numerical Python codes. This combination allows readers to experience parametric phenomena from various directions and apply their understanding directly to their own projects},

This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the physics of quantum noise and its connections to quantum measurement and quantum amplification. After introducing quantum noise spectra and methods for their detection, we describe the basics of weak continuous measurements. Particular attention is given to treating the standard quantum limit on linear amplifiers and position detectors using a general linear-response framework. We show how this approach relates to the standard Haus-Caves quantum limit for a bosonic amplifier known in quantum optics, and illustrate its application for the case of electrical circuits, including mesoscopic detectors and resonant cavity detectors.},

	title = {Quantum noise reduction using squeezed states in {LIGO}},
	abstract = {Direct detection of gravitational waves will require earth based detectors to measure strains of the order 10−21, at frequencies of 100 Hz, a sensitivity that has been accomplished with the initial generation of LIGO interferometric gravitational wave detectors. A new generation of detectors currently under construction is designed improve on the sensitivity of the initial detectors by about a factor of 10. The quantum nature of light will limit the sensitivity of these Advanced LIGO interferometers at most frequencies; new approaches to reducing the quantum noise will be needed to improve the sensitivity further. This quantum noise originates from the vacuum ﬂuctuations that enter the unused port of the interferometer and interfere with the laser light. Vacuum ﬂuctuations have the minimum noise allowed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, ∆X1∆X2 ≥ 1, where the two quadratures X1 and X2 are non-commuting observables responsible for the two forms of quantum noise, shot noise and radiation pressure noise. By replacing the vacuum ﬂuctuations entering the interferometer with squeezed states, which have lower noise in one quadrature than the vacuum state, we have reduced the shot noise of a LIGO interferometer. The sensitivity to gravitational waves measured during this experiment represents the best sensitivity achieved to date at frequencies above 200 Hz, and possibly the ﬁrst time that squeezing has been measured in an interferometer at frequencies below 700 Hz. The possibility that injection of squeezed states could introduce environmental noise couplings that would degrade the crucial but fragile low frequency sensitivity of a LIGO interferometer has been a major concern in planning to implement squeezing as part of baseline interferometer operations. These results demonstrate that squeezing is compatible with the low frequency sensitivity of a full scale gravitational wave interferometer. We also investigated the limits to the level of squeezing observed, including optical losses and ﬂuctuations of the squeezing angle. The lessons learned should allow for responsible planning to implement squeezing in Advanced LIGO, either as an alternative to high power operation or an early upgrade to improve the sensitivity. This thesis is available at DSpace@MIT and has LIGO document number P1300006.},

	abstract = {The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision, giving rise to an apparent limitation known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Gravitational-wave detectors use photons to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors and so are affected by the SQL. We investigated the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) after the experimental realization of frequency-dependent squeezing designed to surpass the SQL. For the LIGO Livingston detector, we found that the upgrade reduces quantum noise below the SQL by a maximum of three decibels between 35 and 75 hertz while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, increasing the overall detector sensitivity during astrophysical observations.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Gravitational wave detectors use kilometers-long interferometers to measure tiny expansions and contractions of spacetime. The precision of those measurements is limited due to quantum mechanics. Theoretically, that quantum limit could be surpassed by using squeezed states of light, and a suitable filter cavity could extend the advantage over a wide frequency range (see the Perspective by Aso).

The authors demonstrate that the upgrades improved the sensitivity of the detector over a wide range of frequencies. Over a smaller range, it surpassed the quantum limit. —Keith T. Smith},

Our aim is to show the reader how the equations describing such measurements are derived and manipulated in a direct manner. We also give elementary background material for those new to measurement theory, and describe further various aspects of continuous measurements that should be helpful to those wanting to use such measurements in applications. Specifically, we use the simple and direct approach of generalized measurements to derive the stochastic master equation describing the continuous measurements of observables, give a tutorial on stochastic calculus, treat multiple observers and inefficient detection, examine a general form of the measurement master equation, and show how the master equation leads to information gain and disturbance. To conclude, we give a detailed treatment of imaging the resonance fluorescence from a single atom as a concrete example of how a continuous position measurement arises in a physical system.},

The derivation is based on the physics involved and the final result is stated in terms of the physical parameters of the setup. To illustrate the predictions contained in the equation, we solve it analytically for a specific system, and we demonstrate quantum jumps and freezing of the internal coherent dynamics of the system as a result of continued measurements.},

Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.},
